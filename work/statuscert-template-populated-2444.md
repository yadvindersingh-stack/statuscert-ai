## Extraction Gaps

- The following files extracted with very low text and could not be reliably mined for additional substantive clauses using local text extraction:
  - `TSCC 2444 - Bylaw 1.pdf`
  - `TSCC 2444 - Bylaw 2.pdf`
  - `TSCC 2444-By-law 3.pdf`
  - `TSCC 2444- Declaration.pdf`
  - `TSCC 2444- Budget package 2025-2026.pdf`
  - `TSCC 2444 - 2025 NOFF.pdf`

- These likely need OCR or source-native text PDFs for complete clause-level extraction.
