Dear Condominium Unit Owner: 
As the Insurance advisor for your Condominium Corporation, we feel it is important to make you aware of your 
insurance responsibilities as well as the responsibilities you have to the Condominium Corporation.   Failure to maintain 
adequate Condominium Unit Owners Insurance could result in severe financial hardship should a serious loss occur! 
The Condominium Corporation is responsible for insuring the following: 
 The Building (s) and units as per Builders specifications however, excluding the portion of each unit the Unit Owner 
is  responsible,  as  defined  from  an  insurance  stand  point  (refer  to  Standard  Unit  By-law  if  applicable),  which 
excludes any improvements made or acquired by the Unit Owners; 
 Personal Property of the Corporation, but excluding the Personal Property of the Unit Owners; 
 Liability against the Legal Liability imposed by law, as the result of Bodily Injury and Property Damage, arising 
out of the Corporation‘s activities as a Condominium. This coverage is extended to provide coverage on behalf of 
the Individual Unit Owners but only with respect to their interests in the common elements of the Condominium; 
 Boiler & Machinery coverage as required by the Condominium Corporation. 
 
Your Insurance responsibilities as a Unit Owner are as follows: 
 Personal Property – i.e. furniture, clothing, all personal effects stored in lockers, etc.; 
 Improvements  or Betterments  made  to  the unit,  i.e. wallpaper,  paneling,  light  fixtures,  upgraded  flooring, 
upgraded  kitchen  cupboards,  (Reference  should  be  made  to  the  Standard  Unit  By-Law  if  applicable – floor 
coverings may be fully your responsibility); 
 Personal  Liability – Your  Legal  Liability  for  any Bodily  Injury or Property  Damage  arising  out  of  your  personal 
activities as a Unit Owner, and from the ownership of your individual unit. 
 
Unit Owners should be aware of the following! 
 You may be responsible for the deductible under the Corporations insurance policy if a loss occurs to any property 
the corporation is responsible for insuring. This charge back of the Corporation’s deductible would apply if the 
damage was a result of an act or omission on the part of the Unit Owner; 
 If  an  insurable  loss  assessment  is  valid  under  the  Condominium  Corporations  governing  rules,  you  could  be 
responsible for your share of this special loss assessment.  This could be quite substantial.  
 
“Unfortunately there are many Unit Owner policies in today’s market place that do not provide the coverage or in 
many cases an adequate limit of insurance to protect the Unit Owner against these major concerns.” 
Fortunately Atrens-Counsel Insurance Brokers has developed a Unit Owners insurance policy which is tailored around 
the Insurance Policy of the Condominium Corporation.  The result is a very competitively priced, comprehensive policy, 
which will respond to many of those claims not covered under some insurance policies available today. 
Our exclusive policy is titled “Condo Gold.”
