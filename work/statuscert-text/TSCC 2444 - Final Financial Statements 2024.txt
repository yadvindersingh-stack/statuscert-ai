INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Unit Owners of
Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 2444
Opinion
We have audited the  financial statements of Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 2444 (the
"Corporation"),  which comprise the  statement of  financial position as  at April 30,  2024 and  the  statements of
operations and changes in fund balances of the general fund, reserve fund, and the statement of cash flowsfor the
year then ended,and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In  our  opinion, the  financial statements present fairly,  in  all  material respects, the  financial position of Toronto
Standard Condominium Corporation No. 2444 as at April 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with Canadian Accounting Standards for Not-For-Profit Organizations.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities
under those standards are  further described in  the Auditor's Responsibilities for  the Audit of  the Financial
Statements section of  our  report. We are  independent of  the Corporation in  accordance with the  ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance
with Canadian Accounting Standards for Not-For-Profit Organizations and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Corporation's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Corporation or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Corporation's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with  Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will  always detect a  material misstatement when it  exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.  As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and  perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to  provide a  basis for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting a  material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
(continued)

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
(continued)
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Corporation's internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management. 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
cast significant doubt on  the  Corporation's  ability to  continue as  a  going concern.  If  we  conclude that  a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are
based on  the  audit evidence obtained up  to  the  date of  our  auditor's report.  However, future events or
conditions may cause the Corporation to cease to continue as a going concern. 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and  whether the  financial statements represent the  underlying  transactions and  events in  a  manner that
achieves fair presentation.  
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

TORONTO STANDARD CONDOMINIUM CORPORATION NO. 2444
Notes to the Financial Statements
April 30, 2024
1.Operations
Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 2444 (the "Corporation" or the "Entity") was registered in Ontario
without share capital onApril 24, 2015 under The Condominium Act, 1998.
The purpose of the Corporation is to manage and maintain the common elements (as defined in the Corporation's
declaration and by-laws) and to provide common services for the benefit of the owners of the 305 residential and 2
commercial units of the complex.  For Canadian income tax purposes the Corporation qualifies as a not-for-profit
organization, which is exempt from income tax under the Income Tax Act.
2.Significant Accounting Policies
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for not-for-profit
organizations and are in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, which are applicable to
Ontario Condominium Corporations and Shared Facilities.  The significant policies are:
a) Fund Accounting
The general fund reports common element fees from owners, budgeted allocations of those fees to other funds and
expenses related to the operations and administration of the common elements.
The reserve fund is  an  externally restricted fund which reports the  common element  fees allocated to  it  and
expenditures for  major  repair and  replacement of  the  Entity's  common elements and  assets.  The  basis for
determining the  reserve fund's requirements is  explained in  Note 4.   All  major repairs and  replacements of the
common elements must be charged directly to the reserve fund with the exception of the cost of the reserve fund
study which may be charged to the reserve fund.  Minor repairs and replacements must be charged to repairs and
maintenance of the general fund.  The Entity segregates amounts accumulated for the purpose of financing future
charges to the reserve fund in bank and investment accounts for use only to finance such charges.  Interest earned
on these amounts is included in  the reserve fund.
b) Common Elements
The real property directly associated with the units of the Entity (the "common elements") are owned proportionately
by the unit owners, and consequently are not reflected as assets in these financial statements.
c) Capital Assets
Units and real property not directly associated with the units are recognized as capital assets if they are purchased
or received by the Entity as owner, and either:
   i) they can be sold, with the appropriate approvals, for consideration to be retained by the Entity, or;
  ii) the units or property generate significant cash flows to the Entity from  their use.
Units received by the  Entity at  nominal  cost are  recognized at  a  nominal  value.  Common  personal property is
recognized as  a  capital asset when such property is  purchased for  the  first  time,  and  is  used in  the  operating,
maintaining or repair of the common elements.  Common personal property includes maintenance equipment and
work vehicles.
7.

TORONTO STANDARD CONDOMINIUM CORPORATION NO. 2444
Notes to the Financial Statements
April 30, 2024
d) Amortization
The amortization rate adopted by the Entity for the parking spaces and bicycle locker unit is 4% per annum applied
on the straight line basis having regard to the net realizable value of the parking spaces and bicycle locker unit.  
Based on current resale values, there has been no decline in the net realizable value of the 
parking spaces and
bicycle locker unit and therefore no amortization has been provided for in these financial statements.
e) Transfers
Transfers from the general fund to the reserve fund that are not included in the annual budget, or which are in
excess of budgeted amounts, are not recorded in the operating section of the general fund, rather they are included
in the related fund statement as additions or deductions, as applicable.
f) Financial Instruments
All assets and liabilities, with the exception of prepaid expenses and capital assets, are financial instruments, and
are initially recorded at fair market value and are subsequently recorded at amortized cost.
g) Measurement Uncertainty
The preparation of  financial statements in  accordance with Canadian accounting standards for  not-for-profit
organizations requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Areas of the  financial statements subject to estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts,
amortization of  capital assets, impairment of  capital assets, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Disclosures relating to  commitments and contingent liabilities may  also be  subject to  estimate. In  addition,
professional judgments are applied in determining the classification of certain expenses between the reserve fund
and the general fund and assessing whether the net assets of the Corporation are sufficient for future purposes.
Actual results could differ from management's best estimates as additional information becomes available in the
future. Material uncertainties with respect to the adequacy of reserve fund net assets are described in Note 4.
h) Revenue Recognition
Common element fees are recognized as revenue on a monthly basis in the statement of general operations based
on the budget distributed to owners each year.
Special assessments are  recognized as revenue in  the  appropriate fund when a  formal resolution declaring the
assessment has been passed by the Board of Directors, and when the special assessment becomes receivable by
the Entity from the owners.
Interest and other revenue are recognized in the appropriate fund when earned.
i) Contributed Services
Directors, committee members and owners volunteer their time to assist in the Entity's activities. While their services
benefit the  Entity considerably,  a  reasonable estimate of  their amount and fair  value cannot be  made  and,
accordingly, these contributed services are not recognized in these financial statements.

In fiscal 2019, the Corporation received two parking spaces and a bicycle locker unit from the developer in lieu of
common expense arrears, accrued interest and legal costs.
4.Reserve Fund
The Corporation,  as required by the  Condominium Act,  1998, has  established a  reserve fund for financing future
major repairs and replacements of the Corporation's common elements and assets.
The Board of Directors has relied on an updated reserve fund study based on a site inspection prepared inApril 2022
by Belanger Engineering and  such other information as  was available to  them in  evaluating the  adequacy of  the
reserve fund. The Board of  Directors has  accepted the  recommendations of  the  study.   The  actual reserve fund
contributions including transfers, if any, during 2024 were $767,000,which is different than the reserve fund study
which anticipated contributions of $504,205.   The  actual expenditures from the  reserve fund were $1,689,560
compared to $101,335 estimated in  the  study.   The  closing reserve fund balance was $1,358,855 compared to
$1,604,877 estimated in the study.  Annual reserve allocations in the study increase by 8.35% for one year and then
increase by 2.0% each year thereafter.
Any evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve fund is based upon assumptions as to the future interest and inflation
rates and estimates of the life expectancy of the building components and their replacement costs.  These factors are
subject to  change over time  and  the  changes may  be  material; accordingly,  the  Condominium Act  requires that
reserve fund studies be updated every three years.
5.Budget
The budgeted figures, which are presented for comparison purposes only, are unaudited and are those approved by
the Board of Directors in 2023.

TORONTO STANDARD CONDOMINIUM CORPORATION NO. 2444
Notes to the Financial Statements
April 30, 2024
6.Special Assessment and Interfund Transfer
As at April 30, 2023, the Corporation had accumulated a general fund deficit of $708,442.  Designated reserve fund
assets had been used to fund these deficits, resulting in an interfund payable to the reserve fund of approximately
$583,000.  In the prior year, the Board of Directors approved a special assessment in the amount of $3,470,466, of
which $1,844,239 was to address the shortfall in the closing reserve fund balance and cover anticipated reserve fund
expenditures, including the riser retrofit project.  The remaining $1,626,227 was used to replenish the general fund,
repay the  interfund balance owing to  the  reserve fund, cover certain operating expenditures, and included a
contingency amount of $250,000.  The special assessment was due from owners in twelve equal monthly instalments,
commencing in June 2023.
During the year, the actual riser retrofit project costs incurred were higher than anticipated.  Consequently, the Board
of Directors approved an additional transfer of $262,795 from the general fund to the reserve fund.
7.Contractual Obligations
The Corporation has  entered into  contracts with various third parties to  provide certain services to  manage and
maintain the common elements.
8.Contingencies
The Corporation was named  as  a  defendant in  a  legal claim commenced by a contractor seeking payment  for
services provided in the amount of $44,669, plus interest and costs.  Subsequent to year end, the claim was settled
resulting in the payment of $35,000 by the Corporation to the plaintiff.  The Corporation filed a counterclaim against
the  contractor seeking $200,000, plus interest and  costs, for  damages caused by the  contractor.  Any resulting
amount that may be receivable from the contractor will be recorded in the period in which the matter is resolved.
The Corporation has been named as a defendant in a legal claim commenced by a former owner in connection with
amounts charged back to  the  owner by the  Corporation in  the  amount of  $34,981, plus interest and  costs.  The
Corporation has retained legal counsel and is defending the action.  At the date of the financial statements, the extent
of liability, if any, is unknown and therefore no amounts have been recorded.  Any amount payable by the Corporation
will be recorded in the period in which the matter is resolved.
9.Related Party Transactions
No remuneration was paid to the Board of Directors during the year.
Management is reimbursed for certain administrative costs and paid a monthly management fee by the Corporation,
and collects fees from owners, purchasers and others for issuing status certificates and lien notices.  Superintendent
services are also provided by the management company.  These transactions were in the normal course of operations
and were measured at the exchange amount.

10.Financial Instruments - Risk Management
Credit risk
Credit risk  is  the  risk  of  financial loss should a  counter-party in  a  transaction fail  to  meet  its  obligations. The
Corporation places its  operating and  reserve cash and  investments with high quality institutions and  believes its
exposure to this risk is not significant.  
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk  is  the  risk  that  the Corporation will  not  be  able to  meet  its  obligations as  they become due. The
Corporation manages this risk by setting common element fees at a level which ensures that the Corporation has
sufficient cash available to  pay the  day to  day operating costs, to  fund the  reserve fund in  accordance with the
Corporation's funding plan, and to fund all other funds, as required.
There has been no change to the risk profile of the Corporation during the year.
11.Comparative Figures
Certain reclassifications of the prior year's amounts have been made to facilitate comparison with the current year's
presentation.
